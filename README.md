- Each "User" can create multiple "Patterns"
- Each "Pattern" can have multiple "Comments"
- "Comment" is associated with a "Pattern" through a foreign key relationship
- Each "User" can have multiple "Patterns" in their "ProjectList", and each "Pattern" can belong to multiple "ProjectLists"

## Pages
### The Knit Connect/Home
This is the home page, with a short introduction to the application.

### My page
This is the user’s own page, with lists of liked patterns, their own created patterns and patterns they want to knit. This page will evolve with more features in the future, things like yarn stash and needle range.

### Patterns
This page contains all patterns added by the users with an image and the key facts that a user would look for, like level of difficulty, needle size and knitting gauge and a link to the actual pattern instructions.

### Pattern details
This is where the pattern instructions come, and where you can like the pattern, add it to you projects and also leave comments.

## Features & functionalities
### Account Management
Users can register for an account, sign-in or logout. All content except the home page is only available for logged-in users.

### Admin management
As a superuser you have access to the admin panel accessing the app from backend. The superuser can add and delete users, patterns and comments, as well as publish and unpublish patterns.

### Navigation Bar
From the navigation bar you can access patterns and the user’s own page.

### Patterns
Patterns is an app within the project. Logged in users can view other users’ patterns as well as add their own patterns. They can like patterns and view them as a list in their profile page. They can also add patterns to their list of projects, things they’d like to knit.

### Comments
Logged in users can comment on patterns and share their thoughts or ask questions to the pattern creator.

### Likes
Logged in users can like patterns and those will automatically be added to a list of liked patterns on the user’s own page.

### Add to projects
Logged in users can add patterns to a list of patterns they would like to knit in the future, which is featured on the user’s own page.

### Messages
The app use message functionality to let the user know what happens in the background, such as successfully adding a pattern or comment, liking/unlinking a pattern and adding a pattern to their project list.


## Deployment Process to Heroku
- Create Heroku App
- Set up of necessary environment variables or configuration settings for the application.
- Deployment the application to Heroku using Git. This involves pushing the code to the Heroku remote repository. 
- Heroku will then build the application using the specified buildpack and dependencies. 
- Once the build process is complete, URL can be used to access and interact with the deployed application.
  
## Testing
### Manual testing:
#### Links:	
- The Knit Connect – Home/Index page
- Register – that this takes the user to a registration page, and that it works to register
- Login - that this takes the user to a login page, and it works to login
- Logout - that this logs the user out, and that the user get a question if they want to do so. And that this link only shows when users are logged in.
- My page - That this link only shows when users are logged in and takes the user to a page with lists populated by the logged in user’s activity.
- Pattern – that this takes you to a page with patterns, and that the view details links take you to a detailed view of the pattern with instructions.

#### Functionality:
- Liking/Unliking a pattern – that it adds to the likes count shown at the side of the thumbs up icon, that it gets populated at the user’s page, and the liked patterns list. That the logged in user can’t like their own patterns.
- Add to project – that it gets added to the list of projects to knit at the user’s page.
- Commenting – that the logged in user can leave a comment on a pattern, and also edit or delete it.
- Messages – that all the actions the user takes to send information to the database is being visualized as notifications at the top of the page.
- Add pattern – that the form works, that the user can upload images and add texts in all fields to add a pattern, with validation to ensure unique values for pattern names.

## Future development:
I decided to create two apps in my project, one for patterns and one for users. The reason is that I want to develop the user app with more content related to the user such as creating a more complex user profile with more features, and potentially add different types of users with different levels of access to the content and functionality within The Knit Connect application. Other features that I’m thinking of include is a calculator for different knitting parameters, useful for knitters in their project plannings.
